# Credit_Card_Report
I've been working on an in-depth analysis of credit card transactions using Power BI, and I'm thrilled to showcase the insights and visualizations from this project.
1- Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize credit card transactions, delivering actionable insights on revenue, customer behavior, and expenditure patterns, resulting in improved financial decision-making and strategic planning.
2- Harnessed advanced DAX calculations to create dynamic measures for week-over-week revenue comparisons, enhancing the accuracy and depth of financial analysis, and enabling the identification of key trends and anomalies.
